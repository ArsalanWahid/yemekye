Demo - iOS Project


## Project Overview

This is a Demo Project which was inspired from the **Zomato** & **Yelp** App on iOS. 

The project was made to test my skills as a novice learning iOS development to test my skills
to replicate and explore how to develop features and UI that the mentioned App use to solve
thier respective customers problem.
 
## Project Details

The current project uses:

- Firebase For Login 
- FaceBook Login
- Local Data (Work in prgress to move to backend)



If you find bugs in this project (Which you will as any project :wink:) Please let me know or use the oppurtunity to learn from it and fix it and make a pull request.

*The project is by no means complete and will continue to develop as I learn new skills and add more features.*

Finally have Fun with the project and fixing it.... #development is hard thats why you should practise it.
